                            <div class="teacher-bio" style="display: none;">
                                I was born and raised in Findlay, Ohio and attended Findlay City Schools grades K-12. I was confirmed and baptized at Immanuel Lutheran in Findlay, Ohio. After graduating from Findlay High School, I attended Bowling Green State University. I graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor's Degree in K-12 Music Education. 
                                After graduating from BGSU in 2013, I received a job to teach music for grades K-12 at Frontier Local Schools in New Matamoras, Ohio. In 2014, Stephen and I were married and I continued to teach at Frontier until 2018 when I resigned to relocate with his new job position in North Canton, Ohio. I began substitute teaching until our firstborn daughter, Sarah, was born in 2019. I then received and accepted the call to serve as preschool teacher and director at Trinity in February of 2020.
                                When I'm not teaching, I enjoy spending time with my daughter and all of the family and friends from both sides of our family that I was reunited with by moving back home again after 7 years!

                            <div class="teacher-bio" style="display: none;">
                                I grew up in Neenah, WI as the second oldest of 7 children.  In 1987, I graduated from Dr Martin Luther College, New Ulm, MN, with a Bachelor's Degree in Education with an emphasis on music.
                                My husband, Pastor Krueger, of Immanuel Lutheran Church in Findlay, and I moved with our 5 kids to Ohio in 2004. Previously we lived in Davenport, IA, Pueblo, CO, and Olathe, KS. In each of these areas I was blessed to be able to serve as a teacher at sister congregations or our own congregation. Before we were married I taught at Lutheran schools in Mesa, AZ and Riverside, CA.
                                I began serving Trinity partway through the 2006-2007 school year, teaching both preschool and kindergarten. After three school years I moved to the first and second grade classroom and have been teaching there for the past 12 years. I'm looking forward to again teaching kindergarteners starting in the 2021-2022 school year.  
                                My hobbies include reading and playing piano / organ.

                                I grew up in Lansing, MI and attended school at Emanuel First Lutheran. She attended high school at Michigan Lutheran Seminary in Saginaw, MI. Mrs. Falck attended one year of college at Eastern Michigan University to study Interior Design. Her sophomore year she transferred to Martin Luther College in New Ulm, MN. She graduated in 2000 with a degree in Elementary Education. She was not assigned a teaching position and found work as an optician and substitute teacher in the Cedar Rapids, IA school district.
                                Her first WELS teaching position was K-3 at Good Shepherd Lutheran in Cedar Rapids, IA. Mrs. Falck has also taught in Wisconsin, Colorado, and Illinois.  She has teaching experience in the daycare setting up through 8th grade.

In their spare time they love to travel to National Parks and Monuments. Jeff and Karena were both history majors in college, so they love to take their kids to historic places of interest!
                                Fun fact – she worked as a teen zoo keeper at Potter Park Zoo in Lansing, MI. Her hobbies are CU football, gardening, animals, and art.

                                2000 was a year of several blessings. She married Richard Kretz Jr., son of Richard and Cheryl (Rettig) Kretz of Jenera, OH and also received her first call to Zion Lutheran in Toledo, OH. She taught pre-school, Kindergarten through second, and after starting a family, served as a teacher's aide until moving to Findlay in 2007.
                                Since then, she has served as a remedial teacher/teacher's aide here at Trinity. Their four children have had/have the privilege receiving a high quality, Christ-centered education here at Trinity.
                                Mrs. Kretz is excited and humbled to be called to teach your children this 2022-20023 school year and asks for your prayers and guidance. May God bless the joint work of our teachers, parents, children, and every person in this village.

                <p>Trinity Lutheran School has been blessed to offer multi-grade learning in its classrooms for over 65 years. A multi-grade classroom may be a new style of teaching to some, but much research has been documented on the effects of multi-grade education over the last century. Studies have shown multi-grade classrooms to be beneficial for struggling students and students who are capable of more challenging topics. Multi-grade classrooms also allow the teacher to better meet the individual needs of each and every child.
                    For more information about how a multi-grade classroom functions and to see the benefits of a multi-grade classroom, please view the videos below.
                    For more information about the curriculum or classroom environment, contact us to schedule a visit to one of our multi-grade classrooms.
