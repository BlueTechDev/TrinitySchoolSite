            <h1>Pastor Matt Nowak</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Pastor Matt Nowak. I am glad that you made it to our church's corner of the internet today. We would be glad to see you soon. There's nothing quite like the kindness of our wonderful congregation.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in rural Michigan. My loving, Christian family raised me and encouraged me every step of the way to become a pastor. One of my grandma's favorite stories to tell was how I'd preach to my stuffed animals. "You're going to be a pastor," she would remind me. Like with many things, she was right.</p>
            <p>God has blessed me with a loving wife, whom I met in Wisconsin, where she grew up. We met the year after I graduated from Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary. God has given us 8 years of marriage together and a wonderful daughter. He led us to Ohio in 2016 and has continued to bless our lives with the people that we meet.</p>
            <p>While preaching is a big part of what I do, personally passing along that same encouragement is important to me. When I have the chance, I like to visit people and talk to them. There are endless things to love and enjoy about teaching people about God, his Word, and his will for our lives. As much joy as I have in preaching and teaching in church, I receive even greater blessings by meeting you and sharing God's Word with you personally. So let's grab a coffee sometime. I might even share with you the secret on how it is made. (Although it's probably not a secret because you can Google that.)</p>

            <p>Please do sign up for the "waiting list" if a session is listed as "full." We usually have several cancellations! We also have the option of adding an extra session if we have enough children on the waiting list.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What happens if I am on the waiting list?</strong><br>If there are any cancellations, we will then move to the waiting list. We will text/email/call you using the information provided during your registration.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How much does Mornings with Mommy cost?</strong><br>Each session costs $5.00 for each family (NOT per child). The registration fees are used to cover crafts, supplies, and snacks.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Who is Mornings with Mommy for?</strong><br>Mornings with Mommy is for children ages 0-6 accompanied by an adult (Dads, Grandmas, Grandpas, and nannies are welcome, too! It's not just for Moms).</p>
            
            <p><strong>What will we be doing at Mornings with Mommy?</strong><br>Each session is a little different because each one has its own theme, but the basic structure will be consistent. We will begin with language and literacy activities on the big rug (stories, flannel board, and songs). After that, children and caregivers can explore the different stations set up in the room. These stations will include arts, crafts, sensory bins, educational activities, pretend play, gross motor skills, and fine motor skills. You can do these activities at your own pace while enjoying the company of the other adults. At 10:30, a snack will be served. You may enjoy it at Mornings with Mommy or take it to go for the ride home.</p>
